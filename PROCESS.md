# How a room gets modeled

The steps every room follows, from "new room" to a walkthrough. They're the steps the first
room went through (a primary bathroom, October 2026), written down so any room, in any house,
goes the same way. Claude follows this file. Saying "new room: <house>, <room>" in a Claude Code
session in this folder starts it.

Rooms stand alone. A house is just the folder its rooms share, and rooms get placed relative
to each other only when two that touch both exist (see "Houses" below). Nothing has to be done
in order, and a room can stop at any step.

## 0. Start the room

1. Copy `template/room/` to `houses/<house>/rooms/<room>/`. Use short lowercase names with
   dashes, for example `houses/ours/rooms/main-bath`. `houses/` is the person's own private
   repo (`houses/README.md`); if it doesn't exist yet, create it there and copy
   `template/home.html` to `houses/index.html`.
2. If the house is new, copy `template/house/` to `houses/<house>/` and fill in `house.md`
   (the map in `house_layout.py` is optional).
3. Add the room to `houses/<house>/house.md` and to the home page (`houses/index.html`).
   If the house has a map (`house_layout.py`), set `folder=` on the room's entry and rebuild it.
4. Fill in the room's README header: house, start date, status, what the project is.
5. Give the person the shot list and measurement sheet from `intake/README.md` in chat. Keep it
   short, and point out the "no floor plan" option.
6. If the person keeps a project tracker, add the room to it with a one-line next step.

## 1. Intake

Collect the room as it is today in `intake/`:

- **Photos.** Copy the originals in, convert HEIC with `lib/tools/heic2jpg.sh`, look at every one,
  and list them in the table in `intake/README.md` (photo → what it shows).
- **Measurements.** Record them in the measurements table, each with where it came from.
- **Floor plan.** A listing plan, a blueprint, or a room-scan export, if there is one.
- **No plan at all?** Ask for the ceiling height, the room's length and width, and one door or
  window. Estimate the rest from the photos, using a tape measure in the shot and standard sizes
  (80" doors, 4.5" outlet covers, 34–36" counters, known tile sizes). Mark those values
  FROM PHOTO.

Then ask questions. Ask about anything the photos don't settle: which way doors swing, what's
behind a wall, what stays, which wall is "north", things that look odd. Ask a few at a time,
numbered, and record the answers under "Notes from the walkthrough".

## 2. Model the room as it is

1. Put every dimension in `layout.py`, each tagged **MEASURED / FROM PLAN / FROM PHOTO / ASSUMED**.
   Declare the main sizes (wall lengths, room depths, anything someone may tape-measure) with
   `dimension(name, default, src, note)` from `roomkit.dimensions`, and draw each with
   `dim(a, b, src, key=name)` in `room.py`. They land in the room's `dimensions.json`, the
   standard size sheet for every room, and show in the walkthrough (Dimensions button, or hover
   a wall). A value corrected there, or typed into the walkthrough with `lib/serve.sh` running,
   overrides the default in `layout.py`.
2. Build `room.py`. Start from the template's box room. Reuse `lib/roomkit` parts (doors, cased
   openings, outlets and switches, registers, cans, wainscot, shelves, the products already
   modeled). Add a part to `lib/roomkit/parts.py` when another room could use it, and keep
   one-off pieces in the room's own `room.py`.
3. Add a camera for each intake photo (`photo1`, `photo2`, …) and move it until the render
   lines up with the photo. Put the converted photos in `web/before/photoN.jpg`.
4. **Check against the photos.** Render each photo view (`--samples 24 --res 1000`) and compare
   it with the photo side by side. Anything that doesn't line up is a wrong number. Fix it, or
   ask for one specific measurement ("corner to the window trim, please").
5. Show the person the side-by-side comparisons. Stop here if that's all they wanted.

## 3. Ideas and selections

Whenever a product link, screenshot or idea comes in, or Claude suggests one:

1. **Record it in `selections.md` first**, before modeling it: status, link, price, specs, and
   who suggested it. Save the product photo to `intake/products/`, since links break and some
   sites block downloads (ask for a saved page or a direct image link then).
2. **Model it.** Sizes come from the spec sheet. Colors and textures are measured from the
   product photos (`textures/`), and new tile colors go in `lib/roomkit/materials.py`.
3. **Options get a command-line switch** (`--tile-color robin`) so they can be rendered side
   by side. Option sets go in `renders/options/<topic>/`, with a labeled comparison sheet
   (`magick montage`).
4. **When something is picked**, update its status in `selections.md`, make it the default in
   `room.py` with a `# chosen: … (date)` comment, and note what was passed on and why.

After any change to `selections.md`, rebuild its web page:
`python3 lib/tools/selections_page.py houses/<house>/rooms/<room>` (writes `web/selections.html`).

Never drop an option silently. Passed-on options stay in `selections.md` under "Considered"
so the history is there.

### Experts: trades reviews and the designer

Two agents in `.claude/agents/` help here. They read and search, never edit; Claude decides
with the person what to adopt, logs it in `selections.md` (crediting the review), and models it.

- **`designer`** sources real products from the person's style, wants and budget, checked
  against the room's dimensions. Use it when a selection is open or the person describes a look.
- **`trades`** reviews the room as one trade (lighting designer, electrician, cabinet designer,
  plumber, tile setter, general contractor, interior designer) and returns ranked fixes with
  plan coordinates, products, and what to measure first.

Start them in the background, telling each the room folder, the trade or what to source, and
what the person wants. **Offer one** (a one-line question, never run unasked) at these points:

1. After the as-is model checks out: a general contractor or interior designer, for what's
   worth changing and what's risky.
2. When a part of the design settles: the matching trade (cabinets → cabinet designer, a
   vanity or toilet → plumber, tile → tile setter, lights → lighting designer or electrician).
   A room with no planned lighting always gets the lighting offer.
3. When a selection is still open, or the person describes a style: the designer.
4. Before stopping a session in which the design changed: one review by the trade most
   affected, unless it was already done for this version.

Note each review in the room README's "Current state" (trade, date, adopted or not), so it
isn't offered twice for the same design.

## 4. Standard renders and the walkthrough

- `renders/latest/day/` and `renders/latest/night/`: the standard views of the current
  design, refreshed whenever a choice changes. Render on the GPU (automatic) and give ETAs
  (for reference, about 35 s per 1600 px / 64-sample view on a mid-range GPU; time the first
  one on a new machine).
- `./render.sh --export web` re-exports the walkthrough model (seconds, live lighting);
  add `--bake` (~8 min, GPU) to bake the Cycles lighting into it so it looks like the renders.
  Other designs go to `web/variants/<id>/` (same command plus the design's flags) and appear in
  the walkthrough's design picker once listed in `variants` in `web/index.html`. Then update the Selections
  panel in `web/index.html` from `selections.md`.
- **Plans page** (`web/plans.html`): the top-down render (`--cams plan` into `renders/latest/`) with
  the cans and the dimension lines from `core.dim(...)` calls in `room.py`, each tagged measured /
  plan / photo / design / assumed. Add a `dim` for every measurement that comes in, and re-export.
  It's also the check that the model matches what was measured.
- **Selections page:** put product pictures at the top of each section in `selections.md`
  (`![name](intake/products/x.jpg)`).
- Check the walkthrough with a headless screenshot before saying it's done.

## 5. Save and stop

1. Update the room's README "Current state": what's modeled, open questions, reviews done, and
   the one next step. If the design changed this session and no trade has reviewed it, offer
   one now (see "Experts" above).
2. Commit, then push, but only when asked (approval is per request). Room work is committed
   in the `houses/` repo; changes to `lib/`, `template/` or these docs go in this repo.
3. If there's a project tracker, update it with where things stopped and the next step.

## Houses

`houses/<house>/house.md` lists the house's rooms. With a listing plan, every room can go on a
whole-house map before any are modeled: trace the outlines into `houses/<house>/house_layout.py`
(`template/house/house_layout.py` shows the format), run `python3 lib/tools/house_map.py houses/<house>`, and open
`houses/<house>/web/index.html`. Starting a room that's on the map: use its id as the folder
name, then set `folder=` on its entry and rebuild the map. When two rooms that touch both exist, it
also records where each room sits in house coordinates: an origin and a rotation, plus which
doorway connects them. Until then, each room is modeled in its own coordinates, and anything
seen through a doorway is a simple stand-in (as the bedroom was before it was built out for
the bathroom). A whole-house walkthrough loads each room's model at its spot. It gets built
once a house has two connected rooms worth walking between.

## Conventions

- Inches everywhere in `layout.py` and `room.py`. Plan x runs east, y north, z up, with the
  origin at the room's interior NW corner (y is negative inside the room).
- Wall fixtures are built in a local frame: wall at y=0, room toward -y, x along the wall.
  `rot_z` turns that frame onto the wall (0 north, pi south, pi/2 west, -pi/2 east).
  `core.rect_walls()` and `core.to_plan()` do this for rectangular rooms.
- Material names are the contract with the walkthrough. The page's `materials` rules match them
  ("wood", "tile*"), and the shared ones (glass, fixture, chrome, leaves, led, can_lens, mirror)
  work everywhere.
- Quick renders go to `/tmp` or the room's `renders/` top level (not committed). Kept sets go
  in `renders/latest/` and `renders/options/`.
