"""HOUSE NAME: every room, as outlines in house coordinates.

The source for the whole-house map (web/index.html). Rebuild the map's data after changing
this file (from the repo root):

    python3 lib/tools/house_map.py houses/<house>

Units are inches. House coordinates: x runs east, y runs north, z up, with the origin at one
room's interior NW corner (everything south of it has negative y). With a listing plan, trace
outlines in plan-image pixels with px() and list the image in PLANS so it can be drawn under
the map to check them; without one, give outlines in inches.
